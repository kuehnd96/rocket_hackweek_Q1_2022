I am ready to go on this first day of hack week! I feel fortunate to work for a company that takes a few weeks out of the year to allow their employees to level up technically. This time is a gift and I intend to get the most out of it. I am currently listening to the Hack Week kickoff event and then I will jump right into my Udemy course.

I am really excited to start hack week on Monday. I am eager to level up with Angular. I have already created my repo and added some content to my Readme. I am ready to go on Monday!
