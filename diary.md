My first two days learning more about .NET and Angular were a lot of fun. I even worked on this outside of work last night. One of the things I want to level up on is using VS Code to program C# code. I have been using Visual Studio since late 2002 and am a big fan of it but you have to try new tools, too. So far I am liking the C# experience in VS Code; The intellisense and CLI commands are powerful and intuitive. I am missing a few things I use frequently in Visual Studio (drop-down menus for selecting methods in a file, keyboard shortcuts for running the software, etc.) but there is nothing vital that is missing in VS Code and I am getting used to it. Until tomorrow.

I am ready to go on this first day of hack week! I feel fortunate to work for a company that takes a few weeks out of the year to allow their employees to level up technically. This time is a gift and I intend to get the most out of it. I am currently listening to the Hack Week kickoff event and then I will jump right into my Udemy course.

I am really excited to start hack week on Monday. I am eager to level up with Angular. I have already created my repo and added some content to my Readme. I am ready to go on Monday!
